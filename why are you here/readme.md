# Project README

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `PIL` (Pillow)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Running the Simulation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the script using Python. Make sure you are in the directory where the script is located.

   ```bash
   python Shouldyoureallyberunningthis.py
   ```

3. **View the Outputs**  
   After running the simulation, the script will automatically generate:
    - Something......?

4. **Check Generated Images**  
   After the script finishes running, check the directory for the created image

## Customization
- yet there were none
## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any errors related to package imports, ensure that you have installed the required libraries correctly.
- For matplotlib display issues, try running the script in an environment that supports GUI displays or use a Jupyter notebook where applicable.
